 # Hi, I'm Sunny :cherry_blossom::wave::computer: 


Data analyst with Programming, Machine Learning, Statistics, and Visualization skills;  I am currently studying Master’s degree in Business Analytics (concentrate on data analytics). My naturally excellent skills in mathematics and bachelor’s degree in Statistics and Quantitative Modeling provided me a solid foundation and a good intuition in Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning; also, that was my started time (2016) to study Programming Language C++, Regression Analysis, Quantitative Decision Making and other professional skills in data analysis. The passion for data lets me choose Business Analytics Program without any hesitation.
